# Random Turtle Walk

## Purpose
This project creates a visually engaging random walk pattern using Python's turtle graphics module. A turtle moves in random directions (0°, 90°, 180°, or 270°) with a randomly chosen RGB pen color for each step, producing a unique geometric pattern. It is designed for beginners to explore turtle graphics, randomization, and Python's visualization capabilities.

## Features
- Generates a random walk with 500 steps, each 50 units long.
- Uses random RGB colors for the turtle's pen to create vibrant patterns.
- Moves in four cardinal directions (0°, 90°, 180°, 270°) for a grid-like effect.
- Thick pen size (10) for clear visibility of the pattern.
- High turtle speed for quick rendering of the design.
- Closes the window when the user clicks, providing an interactive exit.

## Tech
- Python
- `turtle` (standard library)
- `random` (standard library)

## How to Use
1. Ensure Python 3.7 or higher is installed.
2. Save the `main.py` file in the `random_turtle_walk` directory.
3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
4. Watch the turtle draw a random pattern with changing colors.
5. Click the window to exit when the drawing is complete or at any time.
