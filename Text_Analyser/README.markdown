# Word Frequency Analyzer

## Overview
The Word Frequency Analyzer is a Python-based tool designed for beginners to analyze text files, providing detailed statistics such as character counts, word counts, sentence counts, paragraph counts, and word frequency distributions. It features a user-friendly Tkinter GUI for selecting files, viewing text previews, analyzing content, and saving results. This project demonstrates file handling, text processing, GUI development, and error handling in Python.

## Purpose
The tool analyzes text files or manual input to produce comprehensive statistics, including:
- Total characters (with and without spaces), words, unique words, sentences, paragraphs, and lines.
- Average words per sentence and characters per word.
- Top 10 most frequent words with their counts.

## Features
- **GUI Interface**: Built with Tkinter, offering file selection, text preview, and analysis display.
- **Comprehensive Analysis**: Provides detailed text statistics, including word frequency.
- **Error Handling**: Supports multiple file encodings (UTF-8, Latin-1, CP1252, ISO-8859-1) with graceful error messages.
- **Text Preview**: Displays a 500-character preview or full text with toggle options.
- **Save Results**: Exports analysis results to a `.txt` file.
- **Responsive Design**: Resizes gracefully with a minimum window size of 800x600.
- **Executable Conversion**: Supports conversion to a standalone executable using `auto-py-to-exe`.

## Tech Stack
- **Python**: Core programming language (version 3.7 or higher).
- **Tkinter**: Standard library for GUI development.
- **Standard Libraries**: `collections`, `re`, `os`, `pathlib`, `typing` for text processing and file handling.

## Dependencies
- None (uses Python standard library only).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Python**: Version 3.7 or higher, installed and added to PATH.
  ```bash
  python --version
  ```
- **Optional (for executable)**: Install `auto-py-to-exe` to create a standalone executable.
  ```bash
  pip install auto-py-to-exe
  ```

### Installation
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ThreeFistfulsofFigs/Python_Beginners_Projects.git
   cd Python_Beginners_Projects/word_frequency_analyzer
   ```
2. **Set Up Virtual Environment** (recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   .venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows
   source .venv/bin/activate  # macOS/Linux
   ```
3. **No Additional Dependencies**: The project uses only standard Python libraries.
4. **Optional - Create Executable**:
   - Install `auto-py-to-exe`:
     ```bash
     pip install auto-py-to-exe
     ```
   - Run `auto-py-to-exe` and select `main.py` to create a standalone executable:
     ```bash
     auto-py-to-exe
     ```
     Follow the GUI prompts to configure and generate the executable (e.g., one-file mode, no console).

### Usage
1. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd word_frequency_analyzer
   ```
2. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
3. **GUI Interaction**:
   - Click "Browse File" to select a `.txt` or `.md` file.
   - Click "Analyze" to process the file and view basic statistics.
   - Use "Show Full Text" or "Show Preview Only" to toggle text display.
   - Click "Detailed Analysis" to view comprehensive results in a new window.
   - Click "Save Results" to export analysis to a `.txt` file.
   - Click "Clear" to reset the interface.
4. **Executable Usage** (if created):
   - Run the generated `.exe` file (e.g., in the `output` folder from `auto-py-to-exe`).
   - No Python installation required for end users.

## File Structure
- `main.py`: Core application script with Tkinter GUI and text analysis logic.
- `README.md`: This documentation file.

## Troubleshooting
- **Python Not Found**:
  - Verify Python 3.7+ is installed: `python --version`.
  - Add Python to PATH or use the full path (e.g., `/usr/bin/python3`).
- **GUI Issues**:
  - Ensure Tkinter is installed: `sudo apt-get install python3-tk` (Linux) or verify Python installation includes Tkinter.
- **File Encoding Errors**:
  - The tool attempts multiple encodings (UTF-8, Latin-1, CP1252, ISO-8859-1). If a file fails to load, check its encoding.
- **Executable Issues**:
  - Ensure `auto-py-to-exe` is installed and configured correctly.
  - Verify the output executable includes all necessary files (use one-file mode for simplicity).
- **Other Issues**: Open an issue on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ThreeFistfulsofFigs/Python_Beginners_Projects).
